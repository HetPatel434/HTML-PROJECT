                    According to Owen D. Young, the General Electric Company executive who coordinated G.E.'s purchase of American Marconi, and its transformation into the Radio Corporation of America:
                        "Fifteen years is the average period of probation, and during that time the inventor, the promoter and the investor, who see a great future, generally lose their shirts... This is why
                         the wise capitalist keeps out of exploiting new inventions and comes in only when the public is ready for mass demand". When, after years of losing money, radio finally started to become
                         profitable in the late teens, then grew explosively with the broadcasting boom in the early twenties, the "wise capitalists" at major industrial corporations like G.E. began to enter and 
                         dominate the industry, in particular by buying up most of the major patents. In contrast, after nearly two decades of pioneering work and struggling companies, in 1921 Lee DeForest abruptly 
                         sold most of his radio interests and moved on to other fields. DeForest later explained that he felt the time had come when "the building up of this technique and institution might better 
                         be left in the hands of those with greater capital, influence and personnel to carry on" and further noted that broadcasting "grew amazingly, once the large organizations with ample capital 
                         took hold of it".</p></h4></div>

                            <p><h4>The Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, based in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, also became one of the expanding radio industry's most prominent leaders. Westinghouse was 
                                   a major, and well-respected, manufacturer of electrical appliances for the home, and would become the first company to broadly market radio receivers to the general public. Although 
                                   the company had been involved in radio research to a limited degree during World War One, after the war Westinghouse began to greatly extend its operations, including the purchase of 
                                   the International Radio Telegraph Company -- the struggling successor to Fessenden's National Electric Signaling Company (NESCO). In 1912, following a losing initial decision in a 
                                   lawsuit initiated by Reginald Fessenden, NESCO had gone into receivership, reported in Marconi Competitor Bankrupt from the August 6, 1912 Wall Street Journal. During World War One, 
                                   NESCO exited bankruptcy and was renamed International Radio Telegraph -- its subsequent purchase was reported in Westinghouse Company Enters Wireless Field from the October 16, 1920 
                                   Electrical Review. This article noted that "special attention would be paid to the development of new uses" of radio, and the very next month, inspired by Frank Conrad's broadcasts 
                                   over 8XK, Westinghouse inaugurated a public broadcasting service, designed to promote the sale of radio receivers. The October 28, 1920 Cleveland Plain Dealer announced that the formal 
                                   start of the new service would be To Give Election Returns by Radio on November 2, 1920, from a station located at Westinghouse's main plant in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</h4></p></div>
