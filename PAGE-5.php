                        </p>In the early 1920s both the Marconi company and the 
                        Bell Laboratories were testing car-based telephone 
                        systems. Bell Labs believes its 1924 system was 
                        actually the first two-way, voice-based radio 
                        telephone. </h3></div>

                            the radio telephones used by the military during both

                                </p>Although not yet a cellular system, in  1946 Bell initiated America’s first 
                                commercial mobile radio  telephone system. Bell, as well as Ericsson, Nokia, 
                                and Motorola then went on to develop cell phone technologies  throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
                                 The FCC approved a major allocation of spectrum for mobile radio systems in 
                                1970. In 1973, Motorola’s Martin Cooper was credited with the invention of the first personal, 
                                handheld cellular radio telephone.</h3></div>

                                    spectrum for cellular systems, Ameritech Mobile 
                                    Communications (Chicago) and CellularOne 
                                    (Washington, D.C.) became the first operational
