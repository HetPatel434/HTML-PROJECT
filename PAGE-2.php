                <p><h4> Radio -- signaling and audio communication using electromagnetic radiation -- was first employed as a "wireless telegraph", 
                        for point-to-point links where regular telegraph lines were unreliable or impractical.
                        Next developed was radio's ability to broadcast messages simultaneously to multiple locations,
                        at first using the dots-and-dashes of telegraphic code, and later in full audio.</h4></p></div>

                <p><h4> Although "electromagnetic radiation" is the formal scientific term for what Heinrich Hertz demonstrated with his simple spark transmitter in the 1880s, in addition to "radio" numerous other descriptive phrases were used in the early days, 
                        including various permutations of "Hertzian waves", "electric waves", "ether waves", "spark telegraphy", "space telegraphy", "aerography" and "wireless". 
                        In the November 30, 1901 Electrical Review, a letter from G. C. Dietz offered "atmography" as the answer to What Shall We Call It?, but the suggestion fell on deaf ears. Spark, Space, Wireless, Etheric, Hertzian Wave or Cableless Telegraphy--Which? by A.
                        Frederick Collins in the August 24, 1901 Western Electrician wondered whether the question might eventually become academic, for "In the distant future when all wire systems, both telegraph and telephone,
                        have been superseded by the so-called wireless, there will be no confusing qualifying adjectives, 
                        for there will be no dual systems requiring qualification, and wireless telegraphy and telephony will be spoken of as simply telegraphy and telephony." 
                        So, what's the difference between wireless and radio? "There ain't none" -- both refer to the exact same thing -- explains Edward C. Hubert in Radio vs. Wireless, from the January, 1925, Radio News.</h4></p></div>

                            <p><h4>The 1901 edition of J. J. Fahie's A History of Wireless Telegraphy reviewed in detail the development of pre-radio wireless technologies, up through Guglielmo Marconi's groundbreaking radio work. In 1917, Donald McNicol wrote 
                                   about the importance of documenting radio's "historical narrative", noting: "I believe it to be the duty of those acquainted with views and facts of its introduction to set [the most illuminating essentials] down for the inspection of the ultimate historian".
                                   McNicol's overview of The Early Days of Radio in America, from the April, 1917 issue of The Electrical Experimenter, covered significant events, articles, books and individuals during the period from 1896 through 1904, this time beginning with 
                                   Guglielmo Marconi's demonstrations in Great Britain. (Included in this article are links to twenty-four items mentioned in the review.) In the June, 1917 Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Robert H. Marriott comprehensively reviewed technical 
                                   advances plus the struggles and character flaws encountered during early United States Radio Development. Five years later, with a "broadcast boom" spreading across the nation, Professor J. H. Morecroft reviewed What Everyone Should Know About Radio History,
                                   a two-part series that ran in Radio Broadcast, beginning with its July, 1922 issue. </h4></p></div>
