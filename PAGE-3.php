                    <p><h4>During World War One, a Committee on Public Information ("Compub"), headed by George Creel, was formed to promote the United States war effort at home and abroad. 
                           In the December, 1918 Illustrated World, Donald Wilhelm recounted how the high-powered radio stations of the United States Navy were used for Sending the News to 
                           the Seven Seas -- "broadcasting the truth and the light", as provided "by the most powerful educational institution in the world, the Committee on Public Information".
                           In the September, 1922 Popular Radio, Creel's The Battle in the Air Lanes noted that the World War had been the first to include "Public Opinion as a major force" where 
                           "moral verdicts took on all the value of military decisions", and the United States, with limited access to the international cables, had turned to radio for "reaching 
                           every country on the globe with the American message". A short reference in the February 21, 1919 Boston Herald noted that the American Radio and Research Corporation of Medford, 
                           Massachusetts, in conjunction with Major Foster Veitenheimer, signal officer of the department of the northeast, was planning to "send greetings" to President Wilson aboard the 
                           George Washington as the vessel approached Boston for a planned visit.

                            <p><h4>While radio remained off-limits for the general public during the war, there were occasional hints of what lay ahead. Wireless Music for Wounded Soldiers from the April,
                                   1918 The Wireless Age reviewed a short-range electrostatic induction system that could be used to entertain hospitalized soldiers with music and news. And between the 
                                   cessation of hostilities in November, 1918, and the end of the civilian radio restrictions in 1919, there were scattered reports of military personnel firing up transmitters
                                   in order to broadcast entertainment to the troops -- for example, the January 10, 1919 Springfield Republican reported that Ensign Sanford Lawton Had Christmas at Sea, and in
                                   his letter to his parents noted that, as part of the festivities, "All of the latest music from the states was played over the wireless." A short time later Lieut. R. C. Roberts,
                                   of the Rockwell field radio department, transmitted a "Moonlight Wireless Dance", featuring "an abundance of entertainment for all", from the Battleship Marblehead, off the coast
                                   of San Diego, California, to dancers in Hanger Number 4, as reported in Wireless Phone to Transmit Music for Dance from the February 1, 1919, San Diego Evening Tribune, and Music 
                                   by Wireless, in the March, 1919 issue of Telephone Engineer. In addition, the May 7, 1919 Dallas Morning News reported that U.S.S. George Washington, during its transatlantic crossing, 
                                   had employed its radio transmitter to provide nightly a Concert by Wireless for Vessels at Sea.</h4></p></div>
